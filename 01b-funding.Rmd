## Departmental Funding

Our primary form of funding for MA students is an **Achievement Scholarship** known as a tuition waiver. In order to be eligible for this, you need to be registered for a minimum of eight (8) credits in the Department of Linguistics.

Our primary form of funding for PhD students consists of a **Graduate Assistantship**. A student receiving a GAship needs to register for at least six (6) credits.

Courses counting toward the minimum registration requirement must be wthin the Department of Linguistics, though exceptions may be approved by the graduate chair in cases where courses outside the department are an integral part of the student's program.

Information about Graduate Assistantships and Achievement Scholarships can be found on the [department website](http://ling.hawaii.edu/degree-programs/funding/).

Towards the end of each semester, the Graduate Chair will distribute a funding report form which all continuing students are required to complete and return by the stated deadline. This form asks for your funding request, eligibility for department tuition support, and other information relevant to assigning financial support for the next semester. Filling out this report is obligatory for all students, and especially important for those seeking (or expecting) financial support from the department. Meeting with your advisor is not required, but you can meet with the Graduate Chair if you need help to complete the form.

## Conference Travel Awards

Occasionally the department makes funds available to support conference travel. All current Ph.D studends in good standing are eliguble for this award. Funds are made available retroactively, with applications due in January to fund travel over the previous calendar year.

[Graduate Degree Fellowship](https://www.eastwestcenter.org/education/ewc-graduate-degree-fellowship).

The graduate degree fellowship covers the cost of general tuition and fees for UHM graduate programs, books, housing in an East-West Center dormitory, and partial funding toward meals, health insurance, and incidental expenses. Funding for field study and conference presentations is offered on a competitive basis during the fellow's period of study.

The East-West Center Graduate Degree Fellowship invites applications from:

- Citizens or permanent residents of the United States
- Citizens of countries in the Pacific and Asia, including Russia 

Priority in the student selection process is given to applicants with a demonstrated commitment to the Asia Pacific region.


## Extramural Funding

Occasionally faculty may bring in extra funding for GAships, above and beyond the department's normal GA allotment. These GAships could be full or half positions based on the needs of the position. Credit requirements for all GAships (i.e., department/extra funding and full/half positions) are the same as described above.

Students may also seek funding from outside sources to support dissertation research. Two common sources include NSF and ELDP.

### NSF Dissertation Awards

> This award supports doctoral research that digitally records and documents languages---with an emphasis on endangered languages---through the preparation of lexicons, grammars, text samples and databases, advancing linguistic theory and the study of language. The maximum award amount is \$15,000 in direct costs.

Proposals deadlines are February 15 and September 15, annually. Students apply as co-PI, with their advisor as PI.

### ELDP Small Grants

The [Endangered Languages Documentation Project](http://eldp.net) (ELDP) provides a number of grants, including Small Grants of up to €10,000 to support field work.

> ELDP supports the creation of documentary corpora: collections of materials such as digital video and audio recordings, texts of various kinds. ELDP does not support purely theoretical work or work focused solely on revitalization/maintenance.
